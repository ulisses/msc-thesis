\chapter*{Abstract}
\ac{ESA} uses a big and complex stack of software programs to perform tests in the
Ground Segment Infrastructure, specially the \ac{MCS}.
This engine uses many different tools to ensure the maintenance of the
regression testing infrastructure. Mainly these tests perform black-box
testing to all the software systems used in the Ground Segment by executing scripts mainly written in Python.
These scripts are developed by the Software Testing team at \ac{ESOC} responsible to deliver the \ac{MCS} to the mission's team, so the
satellite can be operated correctly throw \ac{MCS}.
\ac{VST} is one of the companies that provides
these services to \ac{ESA} and an updated tool is needed in order to help reusing the existing tests
and improve the way more tests can be written in the future.\\

An all-in-one framework and tool must be developed in order to allow more complex data to be used as input for the
tests, ultimately the test data shall be automatically generated based on the data from
the \ac{MIB} or generically simply based on their data type
and some rules to restrict the generated data domain.\\
A embedded \ac{DSL} was developed in order to help the user generating the test data for the test scripts that are already written.\\

On the other hand, since lots of functions/methods need full code coverage and with this method is hard to create tests that
cover specific code paths potentially leaving many hidden bugs we present the problem and some solutions for it.
Besides that, software is not a static artifact and is constantly
evolving, so a test data generation technique could be a more suitable mechanism in the development process.\\

As we know, writing these rules to guide the generation of data can be very hard and some times is simply impossible to
crystallize in a pre-condition a ground truth rule to generate every cases the user wants.
So, we will show our tries to automatically infer tests from the existing \ac{OO} code.
There are many approaches trying to tackle this problem and therefore
many tools were developed. Here we will present a study on the most
recent tools that uses: Model-based testing, Specification-based
testing, Constraint-based generation, Random generation and
Grammar-based generation for the most used languages - C, JAVA and C\#.\\
Automated Test Case Generation tools give support for creating test
cases and at the same time ensure test case coverage methodically. The
main goal of this tools is extract information from the program on how
to generate executable test cases.
