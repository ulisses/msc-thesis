\section{Generate Tests from Code+\glsentryname{OCL}}\label{proposal}
Since the Operational Simulator code is not familiar to us, regarding its implementation, it was decided to start solving this problem by inferring the \ac{UML}+\ac{OCL} from the existing code
to be able to work on a more abstract level rather than the implementation.
The idea is to extract tests from the inferred \ac{OCL}, using the Partition Analysis described
in \cite{Benattou02generatingtest} and at the same time generate tests directly from the code, using symbolic execution to complement
the specification-based generation from \ac{OCL}. The main goal is to extract as many tests as possible from a model and from the implementation 
to provide information to a feedback loop\cite{Xie03mutuallyenhancing}
test generation framework with two test prespectives, functional and structural, and from there be able to get a more refined set of tests.\\
A combination of both, symbolic execution from Pex and complex data generation from Korat, it will be designed and implemented to
generate more interesting inputs for the methods under testing.
